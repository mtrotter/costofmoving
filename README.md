costofmoving
============

This is a bare-bones life years remaining calculator that I made for my Insight application. It lives at costofmoving.appspot.com

The main input form takes the your current age, gender and the country you live in (country A) and estimates your remaining life expectancy in that country and in a second country you might like to move to (country B). Then it tells you how many years of life you would lose/gain by moving to country B tomorrow. I gitignored all the data files from Human Mortality Database, but they will gladly give anyone access to the data who asks politely (and registers an account).
